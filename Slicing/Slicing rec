Slicer Recomendations

Walls:      0.5 line with, 0.2-0.3 layer height
Bottom/Top: 1.5 mm shell

You do need a good calibrated extruder as parts are tight so check your flow. All parts are modeled with tolerance to fit

I reccomend using 0.1 mm horizontal expansion for better tolerance on small horizontal holes

Support touching buidlplate is needed on some parts - Check screendumps in folder
