Slicer Recomendations
Material: PLA OR PETG - Personally I used PLA on most parts as they are more rigid and give better tolerance

Walls:      3 perimeters with 0.5 line width
Bottom/Top: 1.5 mm shell at 0.2-0.3 layer height
Infill:		30%

You do need a good calibrated extruder as parts are tight so check your flow. All parts are modeled with tolerance to fit

Support touching buidlplate is needed on some parts - Check screendumps in folder

X Slider has built in support wall - needs option: Print thin walls in slicer
