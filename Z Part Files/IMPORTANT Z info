I have experienced some bed tilting after rebuilding the Z setup.

I will troubleshoot this this week and have a suggestion for how to solve this in the next week.

I will try to keep the files as is and will give notice if changes are made

Thanks for your support and dont hesitate to contact me with questions

Regards Roy
